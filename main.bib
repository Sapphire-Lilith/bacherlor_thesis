  abstract  = {Software requirements specification is a critical activity of the software process, as errors at this stage inevitably lead to problems later on in system design and implementation. The requirements are written in natural language, with the potential for ambiguity, contradiction or misunderstanding, or simply an inability of developers to deal with a large amount of information. This paper proposes a methodology for the natural language processing of textual descriptions of the requirements of an unlimited natural language and their automatic mapping to the object-oriented analysis model.},

  abstract = {The richness of social media data has opened a new avenue for social science research to gain insights into human behaviors and experiences. In particular, emerging data-driven approaches relying on topic models provide entirely new perspectives on interpreting social phenomena. However, the short, text-heavy, and unstructured nature of social media content often leads to methodological challenges in both data collection and analysis. In order to bridge the developing field of computational science and empirical social research, this study aims to evaluate the performance of four topic modeling techniques; namely latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. In view of the interplay between human relations and digital media, this research takes Twitter posts as the reference point and assesses the performance of different algorithms concerning their strengths and weaknesses in a social science context. Based on certain details during the analytical procedures and on quality issues, this research sheds light on the efficacy of using BERTopic and NMF to analyze Twitter data.}

  abstract = {Context:Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been successfully used in the literature to extract topics from software documents and support developers in various software engineering tasks. While LDA has been mostly used with default settings, previous studies showed that default hyperparameter values generate sub-optimal topics from software documents. Objective: Recent studies applied meta-heuristic search (mostly evolutionary algorithms) to configure LDA in an unsupervised and automated fashion. However, previous work advocated for different meta-heuristics and surrogate metrics to optimize. The objective of this paper is to shed light on the influence of these two factors when tuning LDA for SE tasks. Method:We empirically evaluated and compared seven state-of-the-art meta-heuristics and three alternative surrogate metrics (i.e., fitness functions) to solve the problem of identifying duplicate bug reports with LDA. The benchmark consists of ten real-world and open-source projects from the Bench4BL dataset. Results:Our results indicate that (1) meta-heuristics are mostly comparable to one another (except for random search and CMA-ES), and (2) the choice of the surrogate metric impacts the quality of the generated topics and the tuning overhead. Furthermore, calibrating LDA helps identify twice as many duplicates than untuned LDA when inspecting the top five past similar reports. Conclusion:No meta-heuristic and/or fitness function outperforms all the others, as advocated in prior studies. However, we can make recommendations for some combinations of meta-heuristics and fitness functions over others for practical use. Future work should focus on improving the surrogate metrics used to calibrate/tune LDA in an unsupervised fashion.}
